# ERA-melody-analysis
Code written for melody analysis in Estonian Literary Museum. All code is written to be used in Google Colaboratory using music scores in XML files as the source data and it was developed for scores of Ukrainian ballads which contain repetition and both single-voiced scores and multiple-voiced scores.
This code is based on the code at the address https://github.com/susmet/ERA-melody-analysis/blob/main/notes_durations_custom.py
